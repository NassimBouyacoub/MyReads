# MyReads Project

As part of the "React Nanodegree" training, I was led to create a library application
which allows the user to select and categorize the books they have read, are currently reading, or are
want to read.
The project emphasizes using React to build the application, provides an API server and a
client library that I used to persist information when the user interacts with it
the app.
Creation of an application which allows to:
    • Retrieval of a list of books from an API.
    • Allow the user to categorize books (read, to read, currently reading).


To install the application you have to use NPM to install the dependencies:

    npm install

To launch the application you have to execute:

    npm start


Enjoy! :D
